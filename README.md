# CS-121-PA-5

The purpose of the PA 5 is to Develop and implement an interactive two player Yahtzee game. Yahtzee is a dice game that was invented by Milton Bradley and Edwin S. Lowe in 1956. The challenge of the game is to outduel the other player by scoring the most points. Points are obtained by rolling five 6-sided die across thirteen rounds. During each round, each player may roll the dice up to three  	times to make one of the possible scoring combinations. Once a combination has been achieved by the player,  	it may not be used again in future rounds, except for the Yahtzee combination may be used as many times  as the player makes the combination. Each scoring combination has different point totals. Some of these  	totals are achieved through the accumulation of points across rolls and some are obtained as fixed sequences of values.
